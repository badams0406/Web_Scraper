The Web_Scraper.py Project I began to work on was going to be my final Harvard CS50 Final Project.
However, due to the confusing debate as to the ethicality of web scraping and Indeed.com's confusing Terms of Service,
I settled on a 4-function Calculator using Tkinter as my final project. In its current state, the code is able to pull
the job titles of the first page of listings with additional details being left out as I stopped developing it.
